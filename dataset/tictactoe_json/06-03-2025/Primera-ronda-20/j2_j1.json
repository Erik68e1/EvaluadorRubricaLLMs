Since no cells have been marked yet, this is the start of the game. As the player in control (x), there is no strategic advantage to any specific location just yet, since no information from the opponent (o) is available. However, the most common strategy to start is to take the center of the board, which gives the most potential winning lines with the next few moves. Therefore:\n\nMove: [\"mark\",\"2\",\"2\"]\n\nReason: This move places 'x' in the center of the 3x3 grid, providing flexibility for the next few moves and taking a slightly advantageous position to start the game. If neither player has made a move yet, the center is a strategic starting point.",

  "reason": "Move: [\"mark\",\"2\",\"1\"]\n\nReason: As 'o', responding to the actions taken so far, I choose to mark the cell at position (2,1). This strategy is designed to build a vertical line with the cell previously marked at (3,1) and to try to form a diagonal line with (1,1) where 'x' is placed. \n\nBy marking (2,1), I intend to create multiple threats for 'x': a vertical line between (2,1) and (3,1), and a diagonal line across from (1,1) to (2,1) and potentially to (3,2) if 'x' plays a specific move next. This move also aims to solidify a strong presence on the board and to keep open the possibilities for several lines, forcing 'x' to think carefully about their next move to prevent 'o' from winning.",
