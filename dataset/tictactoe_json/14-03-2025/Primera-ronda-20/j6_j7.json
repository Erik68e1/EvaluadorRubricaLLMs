The winning diagonal for \"o\" is from (2,2) to (3,3), utilizing the move `[\"mark\", \"2\", \"2\"]` as the pivotal center point and now (3,3).\n* **Blocks \"x\" from winning & Wins the game**: These points are correct. By placing \"o\" in (3,3), you've indeed blocked potential winning lines for \"x\" and secured a win for \"o\".\n\n**Entire Game Recap:**\n\n1. **\"x\"** starts with a strategic center-adjacent move.\n2. **\"o\"** counters by claiming the center, controlling key paths.\n3. **\"x\"** responds with a move to challenge \"o\"'s center control.\n4. **\"o\"** blocks \"x\"'s potential row while setting up its own win conditions.\n5. **\"x\"** tries to counter \"o\"'s diagonal ambition and opens new paths.\n6. **\"o\"** seizes the win with a well-placed move, completing a diagonal and blocking \"x\".\n\nThank you for playing this text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game!
