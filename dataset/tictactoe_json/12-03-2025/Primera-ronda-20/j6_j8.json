This move aims to control a corner of the board, limiting \"x\"'s expansion options and creating a potential diagonal win for \"o\" if the opportunity arises. By occupying the corner, \"o\" forces \"x\" to adapt their strategy and think more strategically about their future moves. **(No win/loss at this point)**\n\n**Current State (theoretical):**\n- x | x | b\n- ---------\n- b | b | b\n- ---------\n- o | o | b\n\n**Your Turn (as \"x\"):** Please respond with a move in the format [\"mark\",\"M\",\"N\"] and a brief explanation.",
